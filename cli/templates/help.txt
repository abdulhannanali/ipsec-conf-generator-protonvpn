This utility generates an ipsec.conf file that can be used to generate configuration
for IKEv2 vpn connections for ProtonVPN. You can replace this file 
with the default /etc/ipsec.conf or link it using the include directive 
for ProtonVPN.

This would be specified like this

    include [filename].conf

It helps automating the configuration part so you don't have to manually add 
each server one by one, which can get a bit frustrating. For more information on
how to acquire all the credentials this tutorial might help
